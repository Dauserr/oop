<h1>Gettysburg Address</h1>
<p class="line">Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p>
<p class="line">Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.</p>
<p class="line">We are met on a great battle-field of that war.</p>
<p class="line">We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.</p>
<p class="line">It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
<p class="line">But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground.</p>
